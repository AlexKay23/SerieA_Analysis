This project started by wanting to visualize the success of Atalanta B.C in comparison to other Serie A teams

## Atalanta B.C
Atalanta2024_2025.R file is very much a summary of Atalanta B.C

## AS Roma
Very similar to Atalanta B.C's file, but another team in Serie A I like to follow

## Serie A Shots
This file was created to visualize who shoots where and they type of shots. This is grown out of wanted to compare to Atalanta B.C

## Serie A Team Match Ratings
I developed a formuala to rate each teams match, creating a "score". Here we look at stats on a leauge level, this will be used to compare averages to not just Atalanta, but other teams as well.
