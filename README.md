Very similar to Atalanta B.C's file, but another team in Serie A I like to follow

## Serie A Shots
This file was created to visualize who shoots where and they type of shots. This is grown out of wanted to compare to Atalanta B.C

## Serie A Team Match Ratings
I developed a formula to rate each teams match, creating a "score". Here we look at stats on a leauge level, this will be used to compare averages to not just Atalanta, but other teams as well.
